# Bloggr

Bloggr is built on top of 
* Nuxt.js 
* Tailwind CSS
* Nuxt-Content 
* and other cool stuff (Hyvor Talk, mailerlite, etc...)

It is a **static** blog generator that uses markdown files to generate blog posts.

If you use this project and it saves you time. [How about supporting it?](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/hlassiege)

I created this blog application because I know how **tedious** it is to assemble all the bricks needed to have an SEO-efficient blog, with a clean, accessible design, responsive, with features already integrated (comment system, rss feed, newsletter, sitemap etc...).

All this work, which can take days to do, I'll spare you - **and it's free**.

However, **if you consider that you've really saved time**, **you might consider supporting this work**.
It's optional, but it will be much appreciated.

The first option is to offer me a [virtual coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/hlassiege) representing the value of the time you've saved.

But you can also contribute in many other ways:

- by talking about this project on social networks, on your blog, with your colleagues. 
- by giving this project a star on github
- by contributing to the open source project to improve it

**10% of the benefits will be donated to the [Unicef foundation](https://www.unicef.org/), an organization that helps children in need all over the world.**
